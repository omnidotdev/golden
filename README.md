# 👑 Omni Golden

**The canonical baseline for how Omni code should look, behave, and be styled.**

**Golden** defines Omni's unified configuration for formatters, linters, agents, and style conventions; the source of truth for consistency across every repository in the ecosystem.

Each Omni project should import or reference these configs to ensure a consistent developer experience and codebase quality.

## Philosophy

Omni believes in **clarity through consistency**. Boilerplate tooling and style should get out of the way, allowing creators and developers to move fast without losing precision. Golden embodies this principle: a single baseline, shared by all.
